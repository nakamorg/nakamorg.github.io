Today has been a please do something ab<!-- truncate -->out this and those.

external influence: talk about how some of the major turning points of life were directly influenced by others and all you did qas put in your passion and whole strength to go after those: papa transfer to english medium school, bps instead of dps, vandana mamm mentioned about ias and iit, until that point i didn't had any goal: maybe a police or army peraon(not officer), webt to kcm instead of dps- again thanks to vandana mamm, kcm has vidyadha that year, cleared jee mains - dinday mentioned cs, until that night i didn't even know what cs was and expressed to dinday i would rather like electric or mech. but money had had a major influence over me throughout. opted for cs, campus placement, unexpected settlement in japan, mangal was talking yo maiko ans we met.
