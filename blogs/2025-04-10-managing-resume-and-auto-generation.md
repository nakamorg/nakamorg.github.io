So I brushed up my resume recently and went thrugh the same whole<!-- truncate -->
- checked bunch of documents on what I did - this was spread across multiple places
- gathered all that info
- tried using my old resume google doc and spent a lot more time fixing indentations and margins then adding actual content
- exporting the doc to pdf
- whole buch of copy/pasting around and managing data across all sorts of places - gihub, notion, google doc
- trying to put it all in git repo so I can easily tack what I've done over the years
- still be curating entries and text i want to add to the resume but instead of writijg in prorpittery google docs format, i'll be using ma,rkdown - same text that I'm usibg for the resume blog on this blog and pandoc for pdf generation  (guess we'll be needing pdfs for forseeable future)
