- walk through simple algos (fibo, fac, tower of hanoi, biary search)
- talk about depth and leaves
- talk about T(n) notation. ex: fibo is t(n) = t(n-1) + t(n-2) =~ 2*t(n-1) = 2*(2*t(n-2)) = 2^2*t(n-2) ....
- talk about complex graph algo (comnplexity would be in terms of vertices and edges)
- note about masters theorem
