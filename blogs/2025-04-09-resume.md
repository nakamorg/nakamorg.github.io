### Senior Platform Engineer | SmartNews Tokyo (July 2022 - Present)
- Led upgrade of **20+ EKS clusters** (**2K+ nodes**) across 3 Kubernetes versions by implementing automated EC2 AMI pipeline with **Packer**/**CircleCI**, coordinating API deprecation migrations with teams, and creating rollback strategies; resulted in zero-downtime upgrade and **$60K/year** savings in compute costs
- Scaled observability platform to handle **10B+ daily events** by designing **Kafka**-based buffering system with **otel-collector** and **Refinery**; implemented adaptive autoscaling using historical load patterns and queue metrics, reducing compute costs by **50%** and eliminating processing failures during peak loads
- Led multiple cross-team initiatives to optimize cloud infrastructure costs by **$100K/year** through systematic identification and cleanup of unused resources; developed automated policies for EBS snapshot lifecycle, load balancer pruning, and container image retention across **300+ projects**
- Enhanced security compliance for **ITGC/ISMS** by architecting strict production/non-production separation; migrated **300+ projects** from static credentials to **OIDC** tokens in **CircleCI**, implemented **IAM** role boundaries, and leveraged **VPC flow logs** for cross-environment access detection
- Modernized infrastructure management by implementing **Crossplane**-based provisioning for **100+ systems**; replaced ad-hoc **Terraform** workflows with continuous reconciliation, managing permissions for developers, pipelines and service-accounts across AWS and Kubernetes resources
- Led **dual-stack networking** migration initiative by implementing IPv6 support across VPCs with zero downtime; modified AWS load balancer and DNS controllers for **IPv6/AAAA** record support, created migration playbooks and delegated migration tasks, resulting in reduced IPv4 costs and improved network scalability
- Improved incident response by establishing and following structured protocols for critical production issues; successfully resolved IPv6 routing failures in ad systems, CI/CD pipeline outages, cross-cluster DNS conflicts, and container registry throttling with minimal business impact

### Platform Engineer | SmartNews Tokyo (Dec 2021 - June 2022)
- Enhanced security by replacing legacy **bastion EC2** instance using shared SSH key with ephemeral tunnel instances; implemented CLI tool using **AWS EC2 Connect**, **AWS IAM**-based authentication and **SSH ProxyCommand**, reducing security risks while maintaining familiar SSH workflows for **200+ developers**
- Designed and implemented standardized **E2E** testing framework for **Kubernetes** controllers; built reusable components for infrastructure testing (pod creation, DNS resolution, load balancer provisioning), integrated automated metrics collection and alerting into the framework resulting in reduced **MTTR**

### Software Engineer - 2 | Telus International (Nov 2019 - Nov 2021)
- Led **17-person** distributed team through infrastructure split during company separation; designed and executed zero-downtime migration strategy for **10+ services**, maintaining **99.9% uptime** during transition with minimal impact to developer productivity
- Improved CI/CD reliability by implementing Jenkins **pipelines-as-code** using **Jenkins DSL** plugin, replacing manual pipeline management in Jenkins UI; migrated **50+ pipelines**, implemented **Git**-based version control with PR reviews, enabling automated rollbacks and disaster recovery

### Software Engineer | Works Applications Tokyo (Oct 2017 - Oct 2019)
- Reduced operational toil by developing **ChatOps** automation platform; integrated with internal systems using custom APIs, automated common workflows for attendance tracking and ticket management serving **100+ employees**
- Decreased cloud costs by **$36K/year** through automated environment schedule management; built scheduler system with custom policies for **10+ development** environments, implemented usage analytics and shutdown procedures
