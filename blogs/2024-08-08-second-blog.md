For some time, I wanted to start with a daily blog. Yes, I know I started this blog about four months ago and have only two entries as of now (including this one). Guess I'm mostly into wasting<!-- truncate --> my time finding which blog genertors to use and starting up a blog site but not into writing. Anyways, I wanted a new blog where I could write freely, without going into much details of the things, about my daily life and routine. I've set up a docusaurus blog previously (the one you are currently reading). I spent some time checking if the **mdbook** would be a good fit for this daily journal blog. Fired up a test mdbook book and compared it with docusaurus style blog I had. Docusaurus style felt good to eyes (it looked nice) - so I decided to stick with docusaurus and started a second blog on same docusaurus instance. You can find it at [/journal](/journal) address of this site.

## Detail about the setup
This blog lives at [nakamorg.github.io](https://github.com/nakamorg/nakamorg.github.io) github repo under the top level `blogs` folder. I created a new top level `journal` folder for the secondary blog. Idea is to dump any markdown file in that folder and have it served. To make it work, I updated the plugins section in my config file
```js title="docusaurus.config.ts"
....
....

  plugins: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog',
      {
        id: 'second-blog',
        blogTitle: 'Journal',
        blogDescription: 'Daily journal',
        routeBasePath: 'journal',
        path: '../journal',
        feedOptions: {
          type: ['rss', 'atom'],
          title: 'nakam blog',
          description: 'A daily journal from nakam blog',
          copyright: 'nakam.org',
          createFeedItems: async (params) => {
            const {blogPosts, defaultCreateFeedItems, ...rest} = params;
            return defaultCreateFeedItems({
              // keep only the 10 most recent blog posts in the feed
              blogPosts: blogPosts.filter((item, index) => index < 10),
              ...rest,
            });
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],

....
....
```

That was it about adding a second blog. To make it easily accessable, I added another entry to the `navBar`
```js title="docusaurus.config.ts"
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      hideOnScroll: true,
      ....
      items: [
        {
          to: 'journal',
          label: 'Journal',
          position: 'left'
        },
        {
          href: '/rss.xml',
          position: 'right',
          className: 'feed-link',
          'aria-label': 'rss Feed',
        },
        {
          href: 'https://github.com/nakamorg',
          position: 'right',
          className: 'header-github-link',
          'aria-label': 'GitHub repository',
        },
      ],
    },
    ....
  }
```

If you noticed there are navigation items for feed and github as well, more on them later. Well, that was mostly it. While writing my first journal/daily blog, I realized that it's front-matter follows a pattern. I asked ChatGPT to generate me a bash script to create the blog template. This is what the script looks like

```bash title="daily-blog-creator.sh"
#!/bin/bash
set -eu
# Get the current date in the format yyyymmdd
current_date=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Define the file name
file_name="journal/${current_date}-daily-journal.md"

# Create the content
content="---
title: $(date +%F) Daily Journal
slug: ${current_date}-daily-journal
authors: [umesh]
tags:
- '$(date +%Y-%m)'
- '$(date +%Y)'
- journal
- daily
hide_table_of_contents: false
---
Today has been a please do something ab<!-- truncate -->out this and those.
"

echo "$content" > "$file_name"
```
Running it would create a blog entry for that day. I used the `YYYY-MM` and `YYYY` tags - to make it easier to filter all the blogs from a particular year or month of the year.

That's the end of it. After all this was done I ran the script and wrote the first daily blog, you can find it at [/journal/20240808-daily-journal](/journal/20240808-daily-journal).

## Other changes
I took some time today to fix some glaring issues with this blog. Like fixing the favicon and github, rss icons.
### Favicon
Used [favicon-converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) on my profile image and generated the favicon images and copied those to `static/img` folder. One glaring issue down :relieved:

### Github and Feed icons
This is how the nav bar used to look before
![old nav bar](assets/navbar-20240808.png)
The link for the rss feed of this blog and my github page looked so bad. I looked at how Docusaurus themselves have done it for their site and copied their config. So the navbar config looks like
```js title="docusaurus.config.ts"
....

      items: [
        {
          href: '/rss.xml',
          position: 'right',
          className: 'feed-link',
          'aria-label': 'rss Feed',
        },
        {
          href: 'https://github.com/nakamorg',
          position: 'right',
          className: 'header-github-link',
          'aria-label': 'GitHub repository',
        },
      ],

....
```

```css title="src/css/custom.css"

Feel free to copy it if you need :wink:. I got the Github icon svg from the Docusaurus github repo. As for the rss icon, I downloded the svg from [www.svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/507840/rss) and then converted it to css using [yoksel.github.io/url-encoder](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/).

That's all for today and this post. Ah well, one more thing. This is how the navigation bar looks after these changes (in case the current nav-bar has changed after this blog entry).
![new nav bar](./assets/new-navbar-20240808.png)

Much better than before and I like it a lot as of now.
