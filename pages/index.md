# Hello
Hi - I am Umesh Poswal, owner of Nakam at nakam.org. I've started this landing page to note things about me and, of course, about Nakam. Nakam does not have much to offer as of now apart from the blog entries I keep on this site. I've been working on some things and will put those up here on display as soon as they become a bit presentable.

I keep two blogs on this website.

1. **Blog** - This is where I dive deep into specific topics that interest me, ranging from tech explorations, personal projects, and reflections on life, to broader thoughts about the world.
2. **Journal** - Think of this as my daily diaryâ€”a space where I document my day-to-day life, personal anecdotes, spontaneous thoughts, and whatever else comes to mind. The `Journal` is less about formal writing and more about sharing life as it happens, in its most authentic form.

You can navigate to both the `Blog` and the `Journal` sections from the navbar above.
