I\'ve set up a docusaurus blog previously. I spent some time checking if the **mdbook** would be a good fit this daily journal blog. I fired up a test mdbook book and compared it with docusaurus style blog I had. Docusaurus style felt good to eyes (it looked nice) - so I decided to stick with docusaurus and started a second blog on same docusaurus instance. If you are reading this - you know how to reach this daily blog. I call it *daily blog* but I might not write up daily. As of now though, I feel pretty motivated to write frequently, maybe couple of time a week :grinning:"}]}}')}}]);
