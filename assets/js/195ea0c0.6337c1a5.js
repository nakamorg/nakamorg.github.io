Anyways, I wanted a new blog where I could write freely, without going into much details of the things, about my daily life and routine. I've set up a docusaurus blog previously (the one you are currently reading). I spent some time checking if the mdbook would be a good fit for this daily journal blog. Fired up a test mdbook book and compared it with docusaurus style blog I had. Docusaurus style felt good to eyes (it looked nice) - so I decided to stick with docusaurus and started a second blog on same docusaurus instance.
