We have started the process of preparing pet export documents for Ko-chan, OCI for Maiko and I\'ve been talking at my work for possible remote work opportunities. At the same time, I\'ll be exploring other opportunities if things don\'t work out and as such have started dusting off my resume.\\n\\nIt\'s such hard work to bring your resume up-to-date and also a humbling experience looking at your last resume.

We tried different cables, adapters, restarts, and stuff, but it wouldn\'t budge. At last, I tried an old new cable, and it started charging and didn\u2019t lose it after a couple of seconds (like it was doing before). I, very carefully, placed it on the table\u2014thinking that if I\'m not careful, it might lose charge again. Well, it charged all the way up to 100%. Later, we found that the existing cable had very minute cut marks\u2014most probably cut by Tachan. But the phone didn\u2019t take charge with the other cables we tried and still occasionally shows some issues\u2014so there seems to be some issue with the phone as well.\\n\\nI\'ve been wanting to purchase a new phone for myself; my iPhone is around seven years old at this point. And been inclined to go the Android route (Google Pixel) this time and thought it would be a good time, as both the iPhone (being about 7 years old at this time) or Maiko\'s phone could give out at any time. Well, long story short\u2014I\u2019ve bought a Pixel 8a in white (porcelain?) color and have been tinkering with it since then.\\n\\n\\nOn the 14th, we went to Lake Ashi in Hakone. It was a beautiful place. Maiko\'s company friends also joined, and Maiko was the organizer. I think we were around 35 people in total, including kids. Maiko organized the whole thing\u2014salute to her. Maiko was looking after everyone, and I was looking after Tachan, so we didn\'t get any time to admire the view or even visit the lake on the 14th. Barbecue, drinks, and late-night chats with friends were good, though.\\n\\nTachan had his first-year vaccine the week before. Though he had recovered from the vaccine fever on Monday, he seemed to have developed some stomach bug and had thrown up in the morning in the car and then threw up in the middle of the night and cried a lot. Worried, we headed back home early in the morning. Well, Lake Ashi\u2014we did come to see you but couldn\'t :gomenne: We headed home, and the rest of the crew decided to go fishing. Ah well, Tachan and his stomach bug :sweat-smile:\\n\\nWe had a nice ride home. Tachan tried vomiting a couple of times but didn\u2019t actually. He cried a bit but for the most part enjoyed and laughed on the way home. After returning the car, we went to the hospital in Musashi-Kosugi. The doctor told us that it\u2019s some stomach issue but is getting better. Relieved, we came home.\\n\\nWhile heading home, I received a great news. My younger brother and sister-in-law had become parents to their first daughter. The whole family has been giving suggestions for names since then, but nothing is decided as of now. The baby was born through a c-section. Most of the ladies (Tachan as well) in the house were sick at the time. My `badi Mm-ma` had an operation for kidney stones just a few days before, Mm-ma had a fever, `badi bhabi` is also seeing the doctor about her `rasodies`, and well, the new mother as well. Bloody coincidence.\\n\\nThe baby was kept in NICU for a couple of days (this I got to know about a week later) but has been discharged and certified fit :smile: now. Both the mother and baby are at home, and most of the other ladies in the house have recovered as well.

That place was good, but we needed something bigger, quieter, and on the first/ground floor as we were expecting our first child. The last criterion, first/second floor, wasn\'t something we took into consideration when looking for a new place. But it\'s a great coincidence that we ended up with one, considering the stomping along with all the other sounds Tachan makes. Had there been any other tenant below us, we\'d definitely have been evicted by now :sigh:\\n\\nOur current home is in Hiyoshi; we moved here on 18th Feb, 2023. It\'s a two-story detached house of around 80m^2. There\'s plenty of space for a home office, for doing yoga or a home gym, and for Tachan to run and play around.\\n\\nThe place is overall much better than the previous one. There\'s no train line running just behind the house. Although I liked looking at the trains as they went by the previous house, they used to make a lot of noise as well, and we couldn\'t sleep or work with the windows open. And even though the train lines were just (about 10-20 meters) behind the house, the station was about 4 km away. The new house is about 20 minutes on foot from the Hiyoshi station, although if someone wants, they can take a bus (the bus stop is just about a minute\'s walk from the home) and be at the station in about 6-8 minutes. I usually take the bus to work if the sun is out and it\'s a bit hot but generally walk back home.\\n\\nApart from the nice connectivity, there\'s a dentist, ENT clinic, medical store, and supermarket very close to the house. So most of the time, we don\'t have to walk more than five minutes for stuff.\\n\\nOverall, it\'s pretty good. One drawback is that it\'s pretty old (about 40 years at this point, I believe), and it gets a bit scary during earthquakes. And one more thing, I used to walk around a lot in Hodogaya. Here, not so much. Not quite sure why that is? Maybe because I don\'t have that much free time anymore, or it\'s the lack of sidewalks on the road near the house or the general lack of great scenery nearby\u2014I like looking at buildings/house designs and such."},{"id":"2024/birthday-celebration","metadata":{"permalink":"/journal/2024/birthday-celebration","source":"@site/../journal/2024-09-03-birthday-celebration.md","title":"2024-09-03 Birthday Celebration","description":"It\'s been many days since the last post, so for this one, I forced myself to write, hopefully to get myself back in the flow.

Anyways, enough digression.\\n\\nMXRoute also provides me with a CalDAV server, but that\'s not their strong suit, and they don\'t even advertise or document it. I was trying out their webmail clients and stumbled across it by chance. Long story short, I\'ve got a hosted CalDAV and mail server. But they are not connected with each other, like what you\'d expect with Gmail and Google Calendar. For example: if I add an event and invite someone, they won\'t receive an invitation email (unless I create the event on specialized clients: Thunderbird or the webmail client I discussed above), and similarly, if someone sends me an invitation over email, that won\'t be added to my calendar automatically (on iOS, I click on the invite attachment and add it to my calendar manually).\\n\\nSo, the ultimate goal is to have some kind of connection between these two servers that will allow me to send and receive invites over email. I spent the last couple of days searching for an existing solution, but none seemed to work. Some suggestions were to:\\n- Change my mail provider and use something like Fastmail, Magadu, etc. (that\'s not gonna fly with me - I\'m already on a lifetime sub with MXRoute, and these other services charge you per user per month).\\n- Use a different CalDAV server. I tried Baikal - it solved half the problem of sending out invites but not the receiving part. It\'s written in PHP - so I don\'t want to spend time extending it (not familiar with PHP at all). I tried NextCloud, thinking that it would magically fix my issue and partly because all my internet searches suggested that it would - but it didn\'t. It solved the same thing as Baikal but had tons of other services (mail client, photos, sharing, etc.) that I didn\'t need.\\n- DavMail Gateway - it seemed like something in the right direction but was too daunting to try, and all the docs suggested that it has something to do with Outlook or MS Exchange.\\n\\nAnyways, the point is that I\'ve finally decided to try my luck writing something for my use case myself. The idea is simple:\\n- Read calendar events from CalDAV periodically and send invites using SMTP.\\n- Read emails using IMAP, look for `ical` attachments, and send them over to CalDAV.\\n\\nOf course, I\'ll need to do some state management, like:\\n- Which invites have already been sent\\n- Which changed since they were last sent\\n- Which received invites have been added, and whether the added ones have been changed\\n\\nAnd more complex features might include handling cases where I or the person I\'m inviting don\'t want to accept an invitation or ask for adjustments. But I\'ll try to ignore that for the time being.\\n\\nAs of now, I\'m very motivated. But, let\'s see how much motivation I can summon to actually implement it. I may or may not update this blog if I do actually end up implementing it. So, if you are interested, check out my GitHub org [nakamorg](https://github.com/nakamorg). ChatGPT suggested using `calbridge` as the project name (along with some other suggestions, of course) - so that\'s what it will be.\\n\\nSide note: For some reason, most of my posts get the same publishing date whenever I make a new deploy of the blog (which happens for any change that I make, however minute). I need to figure out a way to prevent that.\\n\\n[Update (2024-08-20)]: I think if I prefix my filename with the date in (yyyy-mm-dd), that should fix the timestamp issue on the blog. I\'ve made those changes and am trying a deploy.

He didn\'t want to take any solids and didn\'t show much appreciation for the milk but drank it anyway (that\'s a relief).\\n\\nMaiko took him to the hospital on Wednesday. The doctor mentioned it was something with his stomach, which makes Maiko think that it was because of the food I give him whenever I\'m eating. But my theory is that it was the cold water during the pool party. I didn\'t tell Maiko\u2014she organized the pool party. The temperature reached about `39.1` by the night, making everyone very uncomfortable. But Tachan was still giggling and playing at times. By this morning, the fever had gone down. But there are rashes all over his body, and they have increased a bit since morning. So, it seems it was neither the food nor the pool party but the `Roseola` fever all along. The doctor mentioned that it\'s normal after the fever and that they should subside by tomorrow.\\n\\n(edit: 2023-08-16) - Rashes made him very uncomfortable in the night. He woke up multiple times and cried a lot, making Maiko and I very nervous. She made calls to some of the hospitals; they asked not to come in as an emergency case and rather visit a clinic in the morning if the condition got more severe. Fortunately, by 8 o\'clock in the morning, the rashes were gone, and he is sleeping like a baby (it\'s 11 o\'clock now).\\n\\nWell, my 2024 H1 performance review came in today. I had a score of `3` and `4`, out of `5`, for impact and competency, respectively. Manager says I need to pick up some flagship project and advertise my work more to gain those juicy impact points.

The primary cake has a bluish hue and a brown bear (edible) on it, and the second one is a chocolate cake (again with a brown bear on it). Tachan can\'t eat chocolate as of now.\\n\\nOh well, today I met (online) two colleagues from our US office. We mostly talked about how to bootstrap a system at our company. The bootstrapping structure we have is a mess as of now because we are transitioning from a legacy cluster, and until we move off them, all the changes to the bootstrapping repo need to be fully backward compatible. There were some major changes in how we handle new and legacy clusters, so it has become a major pain to sustain them together, at least for the end users - as the API we provide them for bootstrapping isn\'t very clean and intuitive.\\n\\nWhile deploying this blog to GitHub Pages, I realized that my custom domain settings get overridden on every deploy. I knew Docusaurus deploy only pushes the build content to a specific branch and wasn\'t updating the repo\'s GitHub Pages settings. After much fumbling, I found that I needed to add a `CNAME` file with an entry for my custom domain to make it work. For Docusaurus, it could be achieved by creating a file under the `static` folder.\\n\\n```text title=\\"docusaurus/static/CNAME\\"\\nblog.nakam.org\\n```\\n\\nAnd, about the earthquake again, the Meteorological Agency has issued a \\"huge earthquake warning.\\" This is gonna be a scary big weekend."},{"id":"2024/daily-journal","metadata":{"permalink":"/journal/2024/daily-journal","source":"@site/../journal/2024-08-08-daily-journal.md","title":"2024-08-08 Daily Journal","description":"Today has been a rollercoaster of unexpected events.

I\'ve set up a Docusaurus blog previously. I spent some time checking if mdbook would be a good fit for this daily journal blog. I fired up a test **mdbook** and compared it with the Docusaurus-style blog I had. The Docusaurus style felt good to the eyes (it looked nice), so I decided to stick with Docusaurus and started a second blog on the same Docusaurus instance. If you are reading this, you know how to reach this daily blog. I call it a daily blog, but I might not write daily. As of now, though, I feel pretty motivated to write frequently, maybe a couple of times a week. :grinning:"},{"id":"2023/layoff-season","metadata":{"permalink":"/journal/2023/layoff-season","source":"@site/../journal/2023-01-23-layoff-season.md","title":"2023-01-23 Layoff Season","description":"This entry I\'ve copied from my Notion.

While some companies are definitely struggling economically, others like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and similar firms, which had huge profits and are still growing significantly, are just using the recession and weak economy as an excuse to trim their workforce.\\n\\nAll this hiring and firing season added `tailwind` and `headwind` to my vocabulary."},{"id":"2023/strategically-important","metadata":{"permalink":"/journal/2023/strategically-important","source":"@site/../journal/2023-01-19-strategically-important.md","title":"2023-01-19 Strategically Important","description":"This entry I\'ve copied from my Notion.

Around a 40% reduction is expected to happen in Japan as well. Though they are asking for voluntary resignations (VRs), if the 40% quota isn\u2019t reached with the VRs, people might be fired as deemed fit by the management. There was a 4-hour meeting with the SmartNews management.

In hindsight, though, the individual might have been important; that\u2019s why they were in that position/role.\\n- Companies/organizations serve their shareholders/stakeholders and are only loyal to the revenue and profits. They won\u2019t think twice before firing you to save some costs."}]}}')}}]);
