That meant that whenever we wanted to run our terraform code, we needed to set some env vars to specify the correct environment's api key. This gets particularly messy on our CI server, as we have a single instance to handle all our environments. When we ran a CI pipeline, there definetely is a way to specify which env it should target and we can very easily use that information in our terraform code. But terraform doesn't provide a native way to read any env vars. It reads ",(0,r.jsx)(n.code,{children:"TF_VARS_xx"})," and target providers can read whetever env vars they expect to configure themselves. In case of Honeycomb, it's ",(0,r.jsx)(n.code,{children:"HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"}),".
