The primary cake has blueish hue and a brown bear (edible) on it and second one is a chocolate cake (again with a brown bear on it). Tachan can\'t eat chocolate as of now.\\n\\nOh well, today I met (online) two colleges from our US office. We mostly talked about how to bootstrap a system at our company. The bootstapping stucture we have is a mess as of now because we are transitioning from legacy cluster and until we move off them, all the changes to the bootstrapping repo needs to be fully backward compatible. There were some major changes in how we handle new and legacy clusters, so it has become a major pain to sustain them together, at least for the end users - as the API we provide them for bootstrapping isn\'t very clean and intuitive.\\n\\nWhile deploying this blog to github pages, I realized that my custom domain settings gets overriden on every deploy. I knew docusaurus deploy only pushes the build content to a specific branch and wasn\'t updating the repo\'s github page settings. After much fumbling, I found that I needed to add a `CNAME` file with an entry for my custom domain to make it work. For docusaurus, it could be achieved with creating a file under `static` folder. Like this (filepath is: **docusaurus/static/CNAME**)\\n```text\\nblog.nakam.org\\n```\\n\\nAny about the earthquake again, Meteorological Agency has issued \\"huge earthquake warning\\". This is gonna be a scare big weekend."},{"id":"20240808-daily-journal","metadata":{"permalink":"/journal/20240808-daily-journal","source":"@site/../journal/20240808-daily-journal.md","title":"2024-08-08 Daily Journal","description":"Today has been a rollerposter of unexpectedness.

I\'ve set up a docusaurus blog previously. I spent some time checking if the **mdbook** would be a good fit this daily journal blog. I fired up a test mdbook book and compared it with docusaurus style blog I had. Docusaurus style felt good to eyes (it looked nice) - so I decided to stick with docusaurus and started a second blog on same docusaurus instance. If you are reading this - you know how to reach this daily blog. I call it *daily blog* but I might not write up daily. As of now though, I feel pretty motivated to write frequently, maybe couple of time a week :grinning:"}]}}')}}]);
