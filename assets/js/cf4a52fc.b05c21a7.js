So, I think I\'m sorted for life or at least next 5-10 years or sooner (if I end up starting a business and then just drop my guards and go with the Google Workspace and equalents). Anyways, enough digression.\\n\\nMXRoute also provides me with a Caldav server but that\'s not their strong suite and they don\'t even advertise or document it. I was trying out their webmail clients and stumbled across it by chance. Long story short, I\'ve a hosted caldav and mail server. But they are not connected with each other, like what your expect with Gmail and Google Calendar. For example: if I add an event and invite someone, they won\'t receive an invitation email (unless I create the event on specialized clients: Thunderbird or the webmail client I discussed above) and similarly if someone sends me an invitation over email, that won\'t be added to my calendar auto-magically (on iOS I click on the invite attachment and add it to my calendar manually).\\n\\nSo, the ultimate goal is to have some kind of connection b/w these two servers that will allow me to send and receive invites over email. I spent last couple of days searching for an existing solution but none seem to work. Some suggestions were to \\n- Change my mail provider and use something like Fastmail, magadu etc (that\'s not gonna fly with me - I\'m already on lifetime sub with mxroute and these other services charge you per user per month).\\n- Use a different caldav server. I tried Baikal - it solved half the problem about sending out invites but not the receiving part. It\'s written in php - so I don\'t want to spend time extending it (not familaier with php at all). I tried NextCloud thinking that it would magically fix my issue and partly because all my internet seaches suggested that it would - but it didn\'t. It solved the same thing as Baikal but had ton of other services (mail client, photos, sharing etc) that I didn\'t need.\\n- DavMail Gateway - it seemed like something in right direction but was too dauting to try and all the docs suggested that it has something to do with Outlook or MS Exchange.\\n\\nAnyways, the point is that I\'ve finally decided to try my luck writing soemthing for my use case myself. Idea is simple\\n- Read calendar events from caldav periodically and send invites using SMTP\\n- Read emails using IMAP, look for `ical` attachments and send them over to caldav\\n\\nOf course, I\'ll need to do some state management. Like: \\n- which invites have already been sent\\n- which changed since they were last sent\\n- which received invites have been added, were the added ones been changed\\n\\nAnd more complex features might include handling the cases where I or the person I\'m inviting don\'t want to accept an invitation or ask for adjustments. But, I\'ll try to ignore it for the time being.\\n\\nAs of now, I\'m very motivated. But, let\'s see how much motivation I can summon to actually implement it. I may or may not update this blog if I do actually end up implementing it. So, if you are interested, check out my github org [nakamorg](https://github.com/nakamorg). ChatGPT suggested using `calbridge` as the project name (along with some other suggestion, of course) - so that\'s what it will be.\\n\\nSide note: For some reason, most of my posts get same publishing date whenever I make a new deploy of the blog (which happens for any change that I make, however minute). I need to figure out a way to prevent that.\\n\\n[Update (2024-08-20)]: I think if I prefix my filename with date in (yyyy-mm-dd) that should fix the timestamp issue on the blog.

She then gathered all our emergency supplies by the door.\\n\\nWe had little pool party, at home, on Sunday. The water was cold and the weather extremely hot - so it was fun. Tachan enjoyed a lot but he keeps to himself and doesn\'t play with anyone else during these times (maybe all the toys, colorful air pumped pool are too simulating for him).\\n\\nTachan showed eleveted body temperature on Monday but we didn\'t give it much thought. On Tuesday, Maiko had work so I took child care leave. By Tuesday afternoon, his temperature for very noticeable and making him a bit uncomfortable but he was still giggly and playing. By the night he had fever of about `38.3C` and was often crying and didn\'t want to take any solids and didn\'t show much appreciation for the milk but drank anyway (that\'s a relief).\\n\\nMaiko took him to hospital on Wednesday. Doctor mentioned it was something with his stomach which makes Maiko think that it was because of the food I give him whenever I\'m eating but my theory is that it was the cold water during the pool party, I didn\'t tell it Maiko - she organized the pool party. Temperature reached about `39.1` by the night making everyone very uncomfortable. But Tachan was still giggling and playing at times. By the morning today, fever has long down. But there are rashes all over his body. They have increased a bit since morning. So, it seems it was neither the food nor the pool party but the `Roseola` fever all along. Doctor mentioned that it\'s normal after the fever and they should subside by tomorrow.\\n\\n(edit: 2023-08-16) - rashes made him very uncomfortable in the night. He woke up multiple times and cried a lot, making Maiko and I very nervous. She made calls to some of the hospitals, they asked not to come in as an emergency case and rather visit a clinic in the morning if the condition gets more severe. Fortunetely, by the 8 o\'clock in the morning, rashes are gone and he is sleeping like a baby (it\'s 11 o\'clock now).\\n\\nWell, my 2024 H1 performace review came in today. I had a score of `3` and `4`, out of `5`, for impact and competency respectively. Manager says I need to pick up some flagship project and advertise my work more to gain those juicy impact points.

The primary cake has blueish hue and a brown bear (edible) on it and second one is a chocolate cake (again with a brown bear on it). Tachan can\'t eat chocolate as of now.\\n\\nOh well, today I met (online) two colleges from our US office. We mostly talked about how to bootstrap a system at our company. The bootstapping stucture we have is a mess as of now because we are transitioning from legacy cluster and until we move off them, all the changes to the bootstrapping repo needs to be fully backward compatible. There were some major changes in how we handle new and legacy clusters, so it has become a major pain to sustain them together, at least for the end users - as the API we provide them for bootstrapping isn\'t very clean and intuitive.\\n\\nWhile deploying this blog to github pages, I realized that my custom domain settings gets overriden on every deploy. I knew docusaurus deploy only pushes the build content to a specific branch and wasn\'t updating the repo\'s github page settings. After much fumbling, I found that I needed to add a `CNAME` file with an entry for my custom domain to make it work. For docusaurus, it could be achieved with creating a file under `static` folder.

I\'ve set up a docusaurus blog previously. I spent some time checking if the **mdbook** would be a good fit this daily journal blog. I fired up a test mdbook book and compared it with docusaurus style blog I had. Docusaurus style felt good to eyes (it looked nice) - so I decided to stick with docusaurus and started a second blog on same docusaurus instance.
