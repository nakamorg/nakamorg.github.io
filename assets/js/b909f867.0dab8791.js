That place was good, but we needed something bigger, quieter, and on the first/ground floor as we were expecting our first child. The last criterion, first/second floor, wasn't something we took into consideration when looking for a new place. But it's a great coincidence that we ended up with one, considering the stomping along with all the other sounds Tachan makes. Had there been any other tenant below us, we'd definitely have been evicted by now :sigh:"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Our current home is in Hiyoshi; we moved here on 18th Feb, 2023. It's a two-story detached house of around 80m^2.

There's no train line running just behind the house. Although I liked looking at the trains as they went by the previous house, they used to make a lot of noise as well, and we couldn't sleep or work with the windows open. And even though the train lines were just (about 10-20 meters) behind the house, the station was about 4 km away. The new house is about 20 minutes on foot from the Hiyoshi station, although if someone wants, they can take a bus (the bus stop is just about a minute's walk from the home) and be at the station in about 6-8 minutes. I usually take the bus to work if the sun is out and it's a bit hot but generally walk back home."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Apart from the nice connectivity, there's a dentist, ENT clinic, medical store, and supermarket very close to the house.

One drawback is that it's pretty old (about 40 years at this point, I believe), and it gets a bit scary during earthquakes. And one more thing, I used to walk around a lot in Hodogaya. Here, not so much. Not quite sure why that is? Maybe because I don't have that much free time anymore, or it's the lack of sidewalks on the road near the house or the general lack of great scenery nearby\u2014I like looking at buildings/house designs and such."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var n=o(6540);const a={},s=n.createContext(a);function i(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:i(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
