Docusaurus style felt good to eyes (it looked nice) - so I decided to stick with docusaurus and started a second blog on same docusaurus instance. You can find it at [/journal](/journal) address of this site.\\n\\n## Detail about the setup\\nThis blog lives at [nakamorg.github.io](https://github.com/nakamorg/nakamorg.github.io) github repo under the top level `blogs` folder. I created a new top level `journal` folder for the secondary blog. Idea is to dump any markdown file in that folder and have it served. To make it work, I updated the plugins section in my config file\\n```js filename=\\"docusaurus.config.ts\\"\\n<filename=docusaurus.config.ts>\\n....\\n....\\n\\n  plugins: [\\n    [\\n      \'@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog\',\\n      {\\n        id: \'second-blog\',\\n        blogTitle: \'Journal\',\\n        blogDescription: \'Daily journal\',\\n        routeBasePath: \'journal\',\\n        path: \'../journal\',\\n        feedOptions: {\\n          type: [\'rss\', \'atom\'],\\n          title: \'nakam blog\',\\n          description: \'A daily journal from nakam blog\',\\n          copyright: \'nakam.org\',\\n          createFeedItems: async (params) => {\\n            const {blogPosts, defaultCreateFeedItems, ...rest} = params;\\n            return defaultCreateFeedItems({\\n              // keep only the 10 most recent blog posts in the feed\\n              blogPosts: blogPosts.filter((item, index) => index < 10),\\n              ...rest,\\n            });\\n          },\\n        },\\n      },\\n    ],\\n  ],\\n\\n....\\n....\\n```\\n\\nThat was it about adding a second blog. To make it easily accessable, I added another entry to the `navBar`\\n```js\\n  themeConfig: {\\n    navbar: {\\n      hideOnScroll: true,\\n      ....\\n      items: [\\n        {\\n          to: \'journal\',\\n          label: \'Journal\',\\n          position: \'left\'\\n        },\\n        {\\n          href: \'/rss.xml\',\\n          position: \'right\',\\n          className: \'feed-link\',\\n          \'aria-label\': \'rss Feed\',\\n        },\\n        {\\n          href: \'https://github.com/nakamorg\',\\n          position: \'right\',\\n          className: \'header-github-link\',\\n          \'aria-label\': \'GitHub repository\',\\n        },\\n      ],\\n    },\\n    ....\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nIf you noticed there are navigation items for feed and github as well, more on them later. Well, that was mostly it. While writing my first journal/daily blog, I realized that it\'s front-matter follows a pattern. I asked ChatGPT to generate me a bash script to create the blog template. This is what the script looks like\\n\\n```bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\nset -eu\\n# Get the current date in the format yyyymmdd\\ncurrent_date=$(date +%Y%m%d)\\n\\n# Define the file name\\nfile_name=\\"journal/${current_date}-daily-journal.md\\"\\n\\n# Create the content\\ncontent=\\"---\\ntitle: $(date +%F) Daily Journal\\nslug: ${current_date}-daily-journal\\nauthors: [umesh]\\ntags:\\n- \'$(date +%Y-%m)\'\\n- \'$(date +%Y)\'\\n- journal\\n- daily\\nhide_table_of_contents: false\\n---\\nToday has been a please do something ab\x3c!-- truncate --\x3eout this and those.\\n\\"\\n\\necho \\"$content\\" > \\"$file_name\\"\\n```\\nRunning it would create a blog entry for that day. I used the `YYYY-MM` and `YYYY` tags - to make it easier to filter all the blogs from a particular year or month of the year.\\n\\nThat\'s the end of it. After all this was done I ran the script and wrote the first daily blog, you can find it at [/journal/20240808-daily-journal](/journal/20240808-daily-journal).\\n\\n## Other changes\\nI took some time today to fix some glaring issues with this blog. Like fixing the favicon and github, rss icons.\\n### Favicon\\nUsed [favicon-converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) on my profile image and generated the favicon images and copied those to `static/img` folder. One glaring issue down :relieved:\\n\\n### Github and Feed icons\\nThis is how the nav bar used to look before\\n![old nav bar](assets/navbar-20240808.png)\\nThe link for the rss feed of this blog and my github page looked so bad. I looked at how Docusaurus themselves have done it for their site and copied their config. So the navbar config looks like\\n```js\\n....\\n\\n      items: [\\n        {\\n          href: \'/rss.xml\',\\n          position: \'right\',\\n          className: \'feed-link\',\\n          \'aria-label\': \'rss Feed\',\\n        },\\n        {\\n          href: \'https://github.com/nakamorg\',\\n          position: \'right\',\\n          className: \'header-github-link\',\\n          \'aria-label\': \'GitHub repository\',\\n        },\\n      ],\\n\\n....\\n```\\ncorresponding css config\\n```css\\n....\\n\\n.header-github-link::before {\\n  content: \'\';\\n  width: 24px;\\n  height: 24px;\\n  display: flex;\\n  background-color: var(--ifm-navbar-link-color);\\n  mask-image: url(\\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox=\'0 0 24 24\' xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%3E%3Cpath d=\'M12 .297c-6.63 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385.6.113.82-.258.82-.577 0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729 1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236 1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93 0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176 0 0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405 1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405 2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22 0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22 0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286 0 .315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12\'/%3E%3C/svg%3E\\");\\n  transition: background-color var(--ifm-transition-fast)\\n    var(--ifm-transition-timing-default);\\n}\\n\\n.header-github-link:hover::before {\\n  background-color: var(--ifm-navbar-link-hover-color);\\n}\\n\\n.feed-link::before {\\n  content: \'\';\\n  width: 24px;\\n  height: 24px;\\n  display: flex;\\n  background-color: var(--ifm-navbar-link-color);\\n  mask-image: url(\\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox=\'0 0 24 24\' fill=\'none\' xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%3E%3Cg id=\'SVGRepo_bgCarrier\' stroke-width=\'0\'%3E%3C/g%3E%3Cg id=\'SVGRepo_tracerCarrier\' stroke-linecap=\'round\' stroke-linejoin=\'round\'%3E%3C/g%3E%3Cg id=\'SVGRepo_iconCarrier\'%3E%3Cpath d=\'M7 18C7 18.5523 6.55228 19 6 19C5.44772 19 5 18.5523 5 18C5 17.4477 5.44772 17 6 17C6.55228 17 7 17.4477 7 18Z\' stroke=\'%23323232\' stroke-width=\'2\'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cpath d=\'M11 19C11 15.6863 8.31371 13 5 13\' stroke=\'%23323232\' stroke-width=\'2\' stroke-linecap=\'round\'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cpath d=\'M15 19C15 13.4772 10.5228 9 5 9\' stroke=\'%23323232\' stroke-width=\'2\' stroke-linecap=\'round\'%3E%3C/path%3E%3Cpath d=\'M19 19C19 11.268 12.732 5 5 5\' stroke=\'%23323232\' stroke-width=\'2\' stroke-linecap=\'round\'%3E%3C/path%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E\\");\\n  transition: background-color var(--ifm-transition-fast)\\n    var(--ifm-transition-timing-default);\\n}\\n\\n.feed-link:hover::before {\\n  background-color: var(--ifm-navbar-link-hover-color);\\n}\\n\\n....\\n```\\nFeel free to copy it if you need :wink:. I got the Github icon svg from the Docusaurus github repo. As for the rss icon, I downloded the svg from [www.svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/507840/rss) and then converted it to css using [yoksel.github.io/url-encoder](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/).\\n\\nThat\'s all for today and this post.

I looked at couple of places but couldn\'t find what I was looking for. Here\'s a very short list of things I wanted for my setup\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n1. I fully own my content without the need for specialized import/export jobs.\\n1. I don\'t want to write CSS/HTML/JS myself. I would be happy writing simple txt files or use markdown files.\\n1. Content can be tracked for changes over time.\\n1. While I would certainly like many people to read what I write. I do not want big players suggesting my content to their \\"users\\". Information overload is a big issue.\\n1. Organic content discovery.\\n1. Mainly static. I do not want (anymore) comments or discussions on the platform itself. They can happen outside and I\'d be happy to edit the blog to link those back.\\n\\nOf course, I didn\'t come with these requirements from the very begining and they may change over time.\\n\\n# Setup\\nSo, what did I do to achieve what I wanted? \\n\\nI am in git and on Github, so using those for version controlling and storing the content made sense. I know if the content is on Github then I don\'t \\"own\\" it - they can pull the plug for some reason - but let\'s not get that cynical and I\'ll probably have the repo cloned on my local.\\n\\nFor building the website, I did an internet search for `how to build blogging website using markdown files`. Couple of results showed up. Two notable were [**mdbook**](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) and [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/). I settled with Docusaurus as it provided some nice features like: tagging, read time estimations, rss feed, nicer looking UI out of the box and most importantly I didn\'t have to spend lots of time fidgeting with how to use it. Though it requires adding some metadata(`front matter`) to the markdown files, I guess I can live with it as it could be easily searched for, removed or edited if needed. I tried mdBook as well, and it felt very slick and clean for what it does and it took me under 10 minutes to set up compared to about an hour and half on Docusaurus. But it would have stitched all the blogs into a single book - which might not feel natural given that I might end up writing on bunch of stuff - which might not necessarily fit into a single book category.\\n\\nGiven that I have the content on my local or on my Github account and its just some markdown files, there are a bunch of options for publishing like using AWS S3, Github Pages, my home-server (which I don\'t run 24/7). I went with github pages(with custom domain), as it was easy to use and it doesn\'t matter - I can change the publisher whenever I want.\\n\\nWell, I guess that is it. Welcome to this blog created with **Docusaurus** and currently being served from . . . maybe check the response headers and stuff because I don\'t know where it might end up six months from now."}]}}')}}]);
