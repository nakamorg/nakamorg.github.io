Thinking about adding github actions to build and deploy this blog instead of running them on a VM on my machine. For some reason<!-- truncate --> I couldn't get myself to install nodejs and npm on my regular workstation. Maybe I should do that as well.

But for the time being I'm going to try my luck with github actions. Just added a github workflow file and pushing this blog file to master should trigger that. So, let get triggering!
