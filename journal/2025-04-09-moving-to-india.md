We've been cooking the idea of moving back and settling in India for the last couple of years. Now that Tachan has come of age where it would be good for him<!-- truncate --> (kind of scared making such statements, really hard to know what's good for him or not in certain scenarios but we try our best) to settle down, we've decided on the period we want to go back (it's go back for me, for my wife and Tachan it's going to). It's late September of this year.

There are lots of things to sort out. Preparations have already begun. We have started the process of preparing pet export documents for Ko-chan, OCI for Maiko and I've been talking at my work for possible remote work opportunities. At the same time, I'll be exploring other opportunities if things don't work out and as such have started dusting off my resume.

It's such hard work to bring your resume up-to-date and also a humbling experience looking at your last resume. The things you did and were very proud of, confidence that it didn't have any spelling or grammatical mistakes - most of those seem so silly and less thought out when you look at those couple of years later that you end up wondering why the current employer even hired you.

Anyways, I've updated the resume and brought in some style changes to the overall layout and the content as well. Up until now it used to live in my Google Drive but I've decided to keep it public from now on and give it a permanent home on this website. I'll put it somewhere under https://www.nakam.org/blog/resume on this website and hoping to keep it up-to-date.
