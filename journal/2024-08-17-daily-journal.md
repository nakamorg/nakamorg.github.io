I did a major revamp to my blogging site. Instead of just serving the blogs, it will now serve my landing page. Blogs, which used<!-- truncate --> to be served at the root URL, have been moved to `/blog` with their RSS feed. Also, doing this meant that the domain name had to be changed from `blog.nakam.org`. It's now at `www.nakam.org`.

Other than that, I've started adding the year as the slug prefix - so you'll see that for all blog posts starting today. I thought it would help me avoid URL collisions while also providing a nice little hint about the publishing year.
