So the earthquake wasn't that severe but there definetely was one around 1945 JST and we<!-- truncate --> experienced something about of magnitude 2-3. I was on the second floor working out and talking to my mon on the phone and rushed down as it came. Maiko came with Tachan in her lap (it's out protocol to gather by the main door in the event of a quake). She then gathered all our emergency supplies by the door.

We had little pool party, at home, on Sunday. The water was cold and the weather extremely hot - so it was fun. Tachan enjoyed a lot but he keeps to himself and doesn't play with anyone else during these times (maybe all the toys, colorful air pumped pool are too simulating for him).

Tachan showed eleveted body temperature on Monday but we didn't give it much thought. On Tuesday, Maiko had work so I took child care leave. By Tuesday afternoon, his temperature for very noticeable and making him a bit uncomfortable but he was still giggly and playing. By the night he had fever of about `38.3C` and was often crying and didn't want to take any solids and didn't show much appreciation for the milk but drank anyway (that's a relief).

Maiko took him to hospital on Wednesday. Doctor mentioned it was something with his stomach which makes Maiko think that it was because of the food I give him whenever I'm eating but my theory is that it was the cold water during the pool party, I didn't tell it Maiko - she organized the pool party. Temperature reached about `39.1` by the night making everyone very uncomfortable. But Tachan was still giggling and playing at times. By the morning today, fever has long down. But there are rashes all over his body. They have increased a bit since morning. So, it seems it was neither the food nor the pool party but the `Roseola` fever all along. Doctor mentioned that it's normal after the fever and they should subside by tomorrow.

(edit: 2023-08-16) - rashes made him very uncomfortable in the night. He woke up multiple times and cried a lot, making Maiko and I very nervous. She made calls to some of the hospitals, they asked not to come in as an emergency case and rather visit a clinic in the morning if the condition gets more severe. Fortunetely, by the 8 o'clock in the morning, rashes are gone and he is sleeping like a baby (it's 11 o'clock now).

Well, my 2024 H1 performace review came in today. I had a score of `3` and `4`, out of `5`, for impact and competency respectively. Manager says I need to pick up some flagship project and advertise my work more to gain those juicy impact points. Off to 2024 H2 :rocket:
