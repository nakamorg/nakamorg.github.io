I did a major revamp to my blogging site. Instead of just serving the blogs<!-- truncate -->, it will now serve my landing page. Blogs which used to be served at root url have been moved to `/blog` with their rss feed. Also, doing this meant that the domain name had to be changed from `blog.nakam.org`. It's now at `www.nakam.org`.

Other than that, I've started adding year as the slug prefix - so you'll see that for all blog posts starting today. I thought it would help me avoid url collisions while also proving a nice little hint about when the post was published.
