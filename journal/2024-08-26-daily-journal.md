Last year, on 27th August at 01:45 JST, Tachan was born. It's 26th August today, and the time is 23:51 JST. He is fast asleep by my side<!-- truncate --> as I write this. He looks even more cute and adorable while sleeping, and I have to summon all my strength to resist hugging him tightly and showering him with kisses.

About 90 minutes ago, we celebrated his first birthday. Nothing fancy — just the three of us. Kochan didn’t join. We didn’t have any plans to celebrate today since the birthday party is on the 31st (weekend), but somehow we still ended up buying a small cake and couldn’t resist celebrating.

He was overjoyed looking at the candle and enjoyed the Happy Birthday song a lot.

Once the candle went out, he was shocked and surprised but started giggling again.

Thank you, Mahadev, for blessing us with such a wonderful gift. Thank you always.

Thank you, Tachan, for choosing us to be your parents. Big love - Papa.
