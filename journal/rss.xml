            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We've been cooking the idea of moving back and settling in India for the last couple of years. Now that Tachan has come of age where it would be good for him (kind of scared making such statements, really hard to know what's good for him or not in certain scenarios but we try our best) to settle down, we've decided on the period we want to go back (it's go back for me, for my wife and Tachan it's going to). It's late September of this year.</p>
<p>There are lots of things to sort out. Preparations have already begun. We have started the process of preparing pet export documents for Ko-chan, OCI for Maiko and I've been talking at my work for possible remote work opportunities. At the same time, I'll be exploring other opportunities if things don't work out and as such have started dusting off my resume.</p>
<p>It's such hard work to bring your resume up-to-date and also a humbling experience looking at your last resume. The things you did and were very proud of, confidence that it didn't have any spelling or grammatical mistakes - most of those seem so silly and less thought out when you look at those couple of years later that you end up wondering why the current employer even hired you.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've updated the resume and brought in some style changes to the overall layout and the content as well. Up until now it used to live in my Google Drive but I've decided to keep it public from now on and give it a permanent home on this website. I'll put it somewhere under <a href="https://www.nakam.org/blog/resume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nakam.org/blog/resume</a> on this website and hoping to keep it up-to-date.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maiko has gone for the evening for her friend's retirement party. Though because of some strange events of fate, everyone except the one being retired is going to join</p>
<p>It turned out that the retiree had got COVID and got to know about it this morning. They messaged Maiko and told her that they are not going to make it to the party. Reservations were already made, Maiko called the restaurant and they told her that late cancellations would cost 3K per person. Now the remaining six people, including Maiko, didn't want to waste 3K/each, so they decided to go and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Winter is finally here. It's been raining for the last two days and temperatures are under 20. The AC has been running on warm mode since yesterday night. A huge pile of laundry is being dried inside the second-floor room with the help of a fan. They are getting dried but have also gotten that weird smell that comes from wet clothes. It seems the sun will be out tomorrow and we and our laundry will be able to enjoy the outside.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been meaning to write but somehow don't seem to have enough time or energy. A lot has happened since last entry. Let's see what I still recall.</p>
<p>Around 9th Sept or so, Maiko's phone, which we'd bought last year around this time, stopped taking charge. We tried different cables, adapters, restarts, and stuff, but it wouldn't budge. At last, I tried an old new cable, and it started charging and didnâ€™t lose it after a couple of seconds (like it was doing before). I, very carefully, placed it on the tableâ€”thinking that if I'm not careful, it might lose charge again. Well, it charged all the way up to 100%. Later, we found that the existing cable had very minute cut marksâ€”most probably cut by Tachan. But the phone didnâ€™t take charge with the other cables we tried and still occasionally shows some issuesâ€”so there seems to be some issue with the phone as well.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to purchase a new phone for myself; my iPhone is around seven years old at this point. And been inclined to go the Android route (Google Pixel) this time and thought it would be a good time, as both the iPhone (being about 7 years old at this time) or Maiko's phone could give out at any time. Well, long story shortâ€”Iâ€™ve bought a Pixel 8a in white (porcelain?) color and have been tinkering with it since then.</p>
<p>On the 14th, we went to Lake Ashi in Hakone. It was a beautiful place. Maiko's company friends also joined, and Maiko was the organizer. I think we were around 35 people in total, including kids. Maiko organized the whole thingâ€”salute to her. Maiko was looking after everyone, and I was looking after Tachan, so we didn't get any time to admire the view or even visit the lake on the 14th. Barbecue, drinks, and late-night chats with friends were good, though.</p>
<p>Tachan had his first-year vaccine the week before. Though he had recovered from the vaccine fever on Monday, he seemed to have developed some stomach bug and had thrown up in the morning in the car and then threw up in the middle of the night and cried a lot. Worried, we headed back home early in the morning. Well, Lake Ashiâ€”we did come to see you but couldn't :gomenne: We headed home, and the rest of the crew decided to go fishing. Ah well, Tachan and his stomach bug :sweat-smile:</p>
<p>We had a nice ride home. Tachan tried vomiting a couple of times but didnâ€™t actually. He cried a bit but for the most part enjoyed and laughed on the way home. After returning the car, we went to the hospital in Musashi-Kosugi. The doctor told us that itâ€™s some stomach issue but is getting better. Relieved, we came home.</p>
<p>While heading home, I received a great news. My younger brother and sister-in-law had become parents to their first daughter. The whole family has been giving suggestions for names since then, but nothing is decided as of now. The baby was born through a c-section. Most of the ladies (Tachan as well) in the house were sick at the time. My <code>badi Mm-ma</code> had an operation for kidney stones just a few days before, Mm-ma had a fever, <code>badi bhabi</code> is also seeing the doctor about her <code>rasodies</code>, and well, the new mother as well. Bloody coincidence.</p>
<p>The baby was kept in NICU for a couple of days (this I got to know about a week later) but has been discharged and certified fit <!-- -->ðŸ˜„<!-- --> now. Both the mother and baby are at home, and most of the other ladies in the house have recovered as well. Bloody coincidence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've had this bug of blogging a couple of times. But it seems that my current setup is kind of working, and I seem to be pretty consistent with it. Before this, I tried a couple of things and forgot about them. One of those things/platforms was Notion. I recently looked at my Notion pages and found I had a couple of entries there. One of those was about moving to our current home. Now, instead of copying and pasting the entry as-is here, I decided to write something fresh.</p>
<p>We used to live in Hodogaya. That place was good, but we needed something bigger, quieter, and on the first/ground floor as we were expecting our first child. The last criterion, first/second floor, wasn't something we took into consideration when looking for a new place. But it's a great coincidence that we ended up with one, considering the stomping along with all the other sounds Tachan makes. Had there been any other tenant below us, we'd definitely have been evicted by now :sigh:</p>
<p>Our current home is in Hiyoshi; we moved here on 18th Feb, 2023. It's a two-story detached house of around 80m^2. There's plenty of space for a home office, for doing yoga or a home gym, and for Tachan to run and play around.</p>
<p>The place is overall much better than the previous one. There's no train line running just behind the house. Although I liked looking at the trains as they went by the previous house, they used to make a lot of noise as well, and we couldn't sleep or work with the windows open. And even though the train lines were just (about 10-20 meters) behind the house, the station was about 4 km away. The new house is about 20 minutes on foot from the Hiyoshi station, although if someone wants, they can take a bus (the bus stop is just about a minute's walk from the home) and be at the station in about 6-8 minutes. I usually take the bus to work if the sun is out and it's a bit hot but generally walk back home.</p>
<p>Apart from the nice connectivity, there's a dentist, ENT clinic, medical store, and supermarket very close to the house. So most of the time, we don't have to walk more than five minutes for stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, it's pretty good. One drawback is that it's pretty old (about 40 years at this point, I believe), and it gets a bit scary during earthquakes. And one more thing, I used to walk around a lot in Hodogaya. Here, not so much. Not quite sure why that is? Maybe because I don't have that much free time anymore, or it's the lack of sidewalks on the road near the house or the general lack of great scenery nearbyâ€”I like looking at buildings/house designs and such.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's been many days since the last post, so for this one, I forced myself to write, hopefully to get myself back in the flow. This weekend, 31st August, we held the birthday party for Tachan. We invited our friends and Maiko's brothers. Maiko's brothers got some work and couldn't make it. Four of my Indian friends, along with their wives and girlfriends, showed up.</p>
<p>It's interesting that so much has changed in just a couple of years. It feels like just yesterday we were out of college and single. And now, most of us are married, and some have kids or are thinking about having them. Things are moving so fast. If you blink longer than usual, you might end up missing a major life event. Tachan himself is growing too fast. I guess all kids his age grow too fast. It feels like just yesterday, he couldn't even sit by himself, and now he is running across the whole house, climbing up the stairs. It makes me both happy and sad. Sometimes I wish that time would stop and we'd stay like this forever, laughing and giggling and running around all day long and then falling asleep in my arms.</p>
<p>The party was a blast. It was good to see everyone in person after a couple of months. There was some exciting news (someone is soon going to be a parent) and lots of discussions about investing/betting in crypto.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, on 27th August at 01:45 JST, Tachan was born. It's 26th August today, and the time is 23:51 JST. He is fast asleep by my side as I write this. He looks even more cute and adorable while sleeping, and I have to summon all my strength to resist hugging him tightly and showering him with kisses.</p>
<p>About 90 minutes ago, we celebrated his first birthday. Nothing fancy â€” just the three of us. Kochan didnâ€™t join. We didnâ€™t have any plans to celebrate today since the birthday party is on the 31st (weekend), but somehow we still ended up buying a small cake and couldnâ€™t resist celebrating.</p>
<p>He was overjoyed looking at the candle and enjoyed the Happy Birthday song a lot.

<p>Once the candle went out, he was shocked and surprised but started giggling again.

<p>Thank you, Mahadev, for blessing us with such a wonderful gift. Thank you always.</p>
<p>Thank you, Tachan, for choosing us to be your parents. Big love - Papa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[For the last couple of days, I have been obsessed with integrating my CalDAV and mail servers. My mails are managed by MXRoute.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last couple of days, I have been obsessed with integrating my CalDAV and mail servers. My mails are managed by MXRoute. I took their lifetime subscription, so I think I'm sorted for life or at least the next 5-10 years or sooner (if I end up starting a business and then just drop my guards and go with Google Workspace and equivalents). Anyways, enough digression.</p>
<p>MXRoute also provides me with a CalDAV server, but that's not their strong suit, and they don't even advertise or document it. I was trying out their webmail clients and stumbled across it by chance. Long story short, I've got a hosted CalDAV and mail server. But they are not connected with each other, like what you'd expect with Gmail and Google Calendar. For example: if I add an event and invite someone, they won't receive an invitation email (unless I create the event on specialized clients: Thunderbird or the webmail client I discussed above), and similarly, if someone sends me an invitation over email, that won't be added to my calendar automatically (on iOS, I click on the invite attachment and add it to my calendar manually).</p>
<p>So, the ultimate goal is to have some kind of connection between these two servers that will allow me to send and receive invites over email. I spent the last couple of days searching for an existing solution, but none seemed to work. Some suggestions were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change my mail provider and use something like Fastmail, Magadu, etc. (that's not gonna fly with me - I'm already on a lifetime sub with MXRoute, and these other services charge you per user per month).</li>
<li>Use a different CalDAV server. I tried Baikal - it solved half the problem of sending out invites but not the receiving part. It's written in PHP - so I don't want to spend time extending it (not familiar with PHP at all). I tried NextCloud, thinking that it would magically fix my issue and partly because all my internet searches suggested that it would - but it didn't. It solved the same thing as Baikal but had tons of other services (mail client, photos, sharing, etc.) that I didn't need.</li>
<li>DavMail Gateway - it seemed like something in the right direction but was too daunting to try, and all the docs suggested that it has something to do with Outlook or MS Exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, the point is that I've finally decided to try my luck writing something for my use case myself. The idea is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read calendar events from CalDAV periodically and send invites using SMTP.</li>
<li>Read emails using IMAP, look for <code>ical</code> attachments, and send them over to CalDAV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I'll need to do some state management, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which invites have already been sent</li>
<li>Which changed since they were last sent</li>
<li>Which received invites have been added, and whether the added ones have been changed</li>
</ul>
<p>And more complex features might include handling cases where I or the person I'm inviting don't want to accept an invitation or ask for adjustments. But I'll try to ignore that for the time being.</p>
<p>As of now, I'm very motivated. But, let's see how much motivation I can summon to actually implement it. I may or may not update this blog if I do actually end up implementing it. So, if you are interested, check out my GitHub org <a href="https://github.com/nakamorg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nakamorg</a>. ChatGPT suggested using <code>calbridge</code> as the project name (along with some other suggestions, of course) - so that's what it will be.</p>
<p>Side note: For some reason, most of my posts get the same publishing date whenever I make a new deploy of the blog (which happens for any change that I make, however minute). I need to figure out a way to prevent that.</p>
<p>[Update (2024-08-20)]: I think if I prefix my filename with the date in (yyyy-mm-dd), that should fix the timestamp issue on the blog. I've made those changes and am trying a deploy. If you do not see same timestamp on the posts, that means, it worked.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Other than that, I've started adding the year as the slug prefix - so you'll see that for all blog posts starting today. I thought it would help me avoid URL collisions while also providing a nice little hint about the publishing year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the earthquake wasn't that severe, but there definitely was one around 1945 JST, and we experienced something of about magnitude 2-3. I was on the second floor, working out and talking to my mom on the phone, and rushed down as it came. Maiko came with Tachan in her lap (it's our protocol to gather by the main door in the event of a quake). She then gathered all our emergency supplies by the door.</p>
<p>We had a little pool party at home on Sunday. The water was cold, and the weather was extremely hot - so it was fun. Tachan enjoyed it a lot, but he keeps to himself and doesn't play with anyone else during these times (maybe all the toys and the colorful air-pumped pool are too stimulating for him).</p>
<p>Tachan showed elevated body temperature on Monday, but we didn't give it much thought. On Tuesday, Maiko had work, so I took child care leave. By Tuesday afternoon, his temperature was very noticeable and making him a bit uncomfortable, but he was still giggly and playing. By the night, he had a fever of about <code>38.3C</code> and was often crying. He didn't want to take any solids and didn't show much appreciation for the milk but drank it anyway (that's a relief).</p>
<p>Maiko took him to the hospital on Wednesday. The doctor mentioned it was something with his stomach, which makes Maiko think that it was because of the food I give him whenever I'm eating. But my theory is that it was the cold water during the pool party. I didn't tell Maikoâ€”she organized the pool party. The temperature reached about <code>39.1</code> by the night, making everyone very uncomfortable. But Tachan was still giggling and playing at times. By this morning, the fever had gone down. But there are rashes all over his body, and they have increased a bit since morning. So, it seems it was neither the food nor the pool party but the <code>Roseola</code> fever all along. The doctor mentioned that it's normal after the fever and that they should subside by tomorrow.</p>
<p>(edit: 2023-08-16) - Rashes made him very uncomfortable in the night. He woke up multiple times and cried a lot, making Maiko and I very nervous. She made calls to some of the hospitals; they asked not to come in as an emergency case and rather visit a clinic in the morning if the condition got more severe. Fortunately, by 8 o'clock in the morning, the rashes were gone, and he is sleeping like a baby (it's 11 o'clock now).</p>
<p>Well, my 2024 H1 performance review came in today. I had a score of <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>, out of <code>5</code>, for impact and competency, respectively. Manager says I need to pick up some flagship project and advertise my work more to gain those juicy impact points. Off to 2024 H2 <!-- -->ðŸš€</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like I am on a streak. Third post within two days. There has been a major earthquake in Kyushu. Fortunately, we didn't feel anything in Tokyo, and all the friends and family members are keeping safe.</p>
<p>Tachan's first birthday is approaching, and we are (mostly Maiko) deciding on what cakes to buy and about the decoration items as well. The primary cake has a bluish hue and a brown bear (edible) on it, and the second one is a chocolate cake (again with a brown bear on it). Tachan can't eat chocolate as of now.</p>
<p>Oh well, today I met (online) two colleagues from our US office. We mostly talked about how to bootstrap a system at our company. The bootstrapping structure we have is a mess as of now because we are transitioning from a legacy cluster, and until we move off them, all the changes to the bootstrapping repo need to be fully backward compatible. There were some major changes in how we handle new and legacy clusters, so it has become a major pain to sustain them together, at least for the end users - as the API we provide them for bootstrapping isn't very clean and intuitive.</p>
<p>While deploying this blog to GitHub Pages, I realized that my custom domain settings get overridden on every deploy. I knew Docusaurus deploy only pushes the build content to a specific branch and wasn't updating the repo's GitHub Pages settings. After much fumbling, I found that I needed to add a <code>CNAME</code> file with an entry for my custom domain to make it work. For Docusaurus, it could be achieved by creating a file under the <code>static</code> folder.</p>

<p>And, about the earthquake again, the Meteorological Agency has issued a "huge earthquake warning." This is gonna be a scary big weekend.</p>]]></content:encoded>
