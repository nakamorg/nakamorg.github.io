Maiko has gone for the evening for her friends retirement party. Though because of some strage events of fate everyone except the one being retired is going to join<!-- truncate --> 

It turned out that the retiree had got covid and got to know about it today morning. They messaged Maiko and told that they are not going to make it to the party. Reservations were already made, Maiko called the restaurant and they told her that late cancellations would cost 3K per person. Now the remaining six people including Maiko didn't want to waste 3K/each, so they decided to go and enjoy themselves.

Winter is finally here. It's been raining for the last two days and temperatures are under 20. ACs been running on warm mode since yesterday night. Huge pile of laundry is being dried inside the second floor room with the help  of a fan. They are getting dried but have also gotten that weird smell that comes from wet clothes. It seems sun san will be out tomorrow and we and our lundry will be able to enjoy the outside.
