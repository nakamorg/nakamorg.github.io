This entry I've copied from my Notion. That's the reason it belongs to 2023, even though I started this blog in August 2024. This is around the time when my then company decided to fire 40% of the workforce.<!-- truncate --> What follows next is the exact (with grammar and syntax fixed) entry from Notion.

On January 13, 2023, SmartNews fired ~40% of staff in the USA and China. Around a 40% reduction is expected to happen in Japan as well. Though they are asking for voluntary resignations (VRs), if the 40% quota isnâ€™t reached with the VRs, people might be fired as deemed fit by the management. There was a 4-hour meeting with the SmartNews management. The CEO says he takes full responsibility for the layoffsâ€”and by that he means to get SmartNews back on track and ensure that SmartNews achieves its mission of delivering quality information. ðŸ¤· Isn't that his job?

I talked with my manager today. He says **my position** is strategically important for the company's future, and they donâ€™t plan to lay me off. Well, thatâ€™s some relief. If I apply for voluntary resignation, my application would be denied.

## Thoughts
- Roles/positions/departments are more important and are of strategic importance than the individuals. In hindsight, though, the individual might have been important; thatâ€™s why they were in that position/role.
- Companies/organizations serve their shareholders/stakeholders and are only loyal to the revenue and profits. They wonâ€™t think twice before firing you to save some costs.
